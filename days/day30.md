# 第三十天 打电话(Telephone Calls)

## 一、会话

Allen: Six eight six four two four three.
Black: Hello, Allen. Is that you?
A: Oh, hello Black. Yes. I’d been expecting a call from you. I thought you said you were going to ring last night.
B: Yes, I know, but I had so many things to do, what with the meeting and everything that I just never got round to it.
A: That’s all right. How are you, anyway?
B: Fine, thanks.
A: And Andrews?
B: Yes, I know. It’s terrible. I just never seem to have a moment to spare these days.
A: No.
B: Although I must admit that I did have a nice break on Sunday afternoon. Andrews and I drove out to Burford to see his aunt.
A: Where?
B: Burford. Well, you know, it’s in the Cotswolds.
A: Yes. I didn’t catch the name. This line is not very good, is it?
B: No. They seems to get worse each time they put the phone charges up. But I was telling you about the trip to Burford.
A: Oh, yes. It was a lovely afternoon, wasn’t it?
B: Mm. It was. I hadn’t enjoyed a drive so much for ages. We went along the M.4 to Reading and then to Newbury and from Newbury… to Burford.
A: That was a long way round.
B: Yes, I know. But we had plenty of time, you see. We didn’t have to get back until late, so we thought we’d take the chance and see a bit of countryside for a change.
A: You lucky thing. It’s ages since we drove anywhere for pleasure. It’s either work or shopping or running someone to the tube when it’s late, and so on.
B: That’s what happens to us most of the time, and that’s what made Sunday so nice. Now, listen, you’re supposed to be coming to tea on Thursday, aren’t you?
A: Yes. It’ll be along about three. That’s all right.
B: Yes, that’s lovely. See you then. Bye, Carol.
A: Bye-bye. Give my love to Andrews.
B: I will. Bye.
