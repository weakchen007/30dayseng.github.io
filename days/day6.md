# 第六天  赞成与反对（Agreeing and Disagreeing）

## 一、会话

### 对话1(Dialogue 1)

Tom: I’m going to go on a diet.
John: What for?
Tom: I’m putting on too much weight and can’t get into my pants and more.
John: That’s silly. You can use a couple of extra pounds.

### 对话2(Dialogue 2)

Tom: Tomorrow is Mother’s birthday. I’m going to buy a big cake for her.
John: She’ll like that.
Tom: My sister and I are going to do the cooking so that mother can have the day off.
John: How thoughtful.

### 对话3(Dialogue 3)

Tom: Do you mean to tell me you don’t care for Beijing Opera?
John: That’s right. I think it’s boring.
Tom: Do you really think so?
John: Yes, I do. I just can’t stand the sound of gongs and drums.
Tom: I don’t want to argue with you, John, but I think you’re being unfair. Beijing Opera has a charm of it’s own and it is well appreciated by both Chinese and foreign music- lovers.
John: Well. I don’t see any point in arguing this. You have your opinion and I have mine.
Tom: Did you see the show last night.
John: Yes, I did. I thought it was a failure.
Tom: Oh, come on! It wasn’t a bad show at all. Didn’t you hear the applause from the audience?
John: Well, It many be so. I still think everyone has a right to his own opinion.
